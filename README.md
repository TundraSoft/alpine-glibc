This is a base docker image used throughout all docker builds. This image uses s6-overlay to help with 
initialization and management of services.

This version has the GLIBC package installed.

## Installed Components

### [`S6`]([!https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay#the-docker-way "S6 Github link") - 3.0.0.2

The s6-overlay-builder project is a series of init scripts and utilities to ease creating Docker images using s6 as a process supervisor.

### Time Zone

Timezone is available pre-packaged. To set timezone, pass environment variable TZ, example TZ=Asia/Kolkata

**NOTE** This does not setup NTP or other service. The time is still fetched from the underlying host. The timezone is applied thereby
displaying the correct time.

### envsubst

Added envsubst to help in applying environment variables in config files. 

### User & Group

Default user and group created with UID as 1000 and GID as 1000. Username and Group Name is tundrasoft tundrasoft (yes not really creative at this point)

## ENVIRONMENT LABELS

### TZ

Timezone which needs to be set for the container. It obtains time from the host machine.

### S6 ENV VARS

See s6 documentation for other s6 environment arguments
